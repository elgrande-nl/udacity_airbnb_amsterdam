## Project motivation
As part of the Udacity Data Science Nano Degree program you have to do a few projects
Based on what I learned in the past chapters I chose to analise the AirBNB from Amsterdam.

During this project I used the first steps of the CRISP method.

1. Business understanding.
So I read about the company and what [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.nl/) is al about.
2. Data understanding.
I read the [Data dictonary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896) to better understand the data that is provided by Airbnb.
3. Data preperation.
So I cleaned the data by looking at the missing data and decide wich aprouch is the best (drop, impute or work arround the missing values).


# Results
1. Almost 78% of the listings in Amsterdam are "Entire home/apt". followed by "Private room" with 21%. and arround 1% are "Hotel/shared rooms".
2. The average price of a listing in Amsterdam is $152.
Where on average a: 
* "Entire home/apt" of $167 is the most expensive room type.
* "shared room" of $81 is the cheapest room type.
3. the majority of all listings are priced below $200, that is not verry different for a "entire home/apt" 
4. Based on the calender data the average price is rising from $152,- to $160,- in januari 2022.
